# Logistic-Regression-with-Gradient-Descent
Logistic regression algorithm using Gradient Descent in analogy with neural networks for p attributes. The objective function minimizes the negative log likelihood value. The implementation is done from scratch in R and analyzes the Auto data set in ISLR library. The code is well commented and self explanatory.
